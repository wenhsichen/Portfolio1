							<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
							<h3 id="contentTitle">Developed a graphical user interface for Massmine to improve user experience and expand target audiences</h3>
							<p>Massmine is a social media data collection tool. The initial version of Massmine website was a command-line based tool that was challenging for users to get started. Our project goal is to create a web application with graphic user interface for Massmine, making it more approachable and expanding its target audiences.</p>
							
							<h4>RESEARCH</h4>
							<h3 id="contentTitle">User expectations for a comprehensive data collection and data visualization software</h3>
							<p><strong>Stakeholder Interview</strong></p>
							<p>From the interview with stakeholders, we learned that the target audience for the application are tech-novice researchers who would require a user-friendly and streamlined graphical user interface. The following are features and information we would provide on the user interface.</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Provide an easy-to-use input for queries</li>
								<li>Provide researchers an overview of collected data</li>
								<li>Provide data exploration through visuals</li>
								<li>Provide researchers with the ability to filter through data</li>
								<li>Provide researchers with the ability to export data</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>Potential User Interview</strong></p>
							<p>Interviewed four professors who are mainly dedicated to social science research. Through these interviews, we aimed to gain insights into their previous experience in collecting and analyzing social media data.</p>

							<h4></h4>

							<p>Interested in the following questions:</p>
							<h3></h3>
							<p></p>
							<ul>
								<li>What kind of data do they use in social media research?</li>
								<li>What software had they used for previous research?</li>
								<li>What will they do with those data? How to analyze the data?</li>
								<li>Do they have any frustration in collecting data?</li>
							</ul>

							<h4></h4>

							<p>We found that users expect the software to have a more comprehensive functionality that enables them to work on both data collection and data visualization within the application. Also, they would need a graphical user interface that makes data collect the data easier.</p>

							<p><strong>Persona</strong></p>
							<span class="image featured"><img src="images/personaMassmine.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h4>IDEATE & DESIGN</h4>
							<p>To begin the design process, we started drafting multiple sketches of the main functions and features for each page, then combined our team members' ideas together and finalize the first draft of the design.</p>

							<h3 id="contentTitle">Wireframe.</h3>
							<span class="image featured"><img src="images/wireframemassmine.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h4>ITERATION</h4>
							<h3 id="contentTitle">Got positive feedback from the usability testing and identified future improvement. </h3>
							<P>After we created a clickable prototype of the graphic user interface of Massmine, we conducted a usability test to examine whether users could interact with our design successfully, which included both qualitative and quantitive methods. Participants were asked to accomplish five tasks related to the primary functions, including the dashboard, navigation, adding projects, exporting data, and data visualization. Through the task, participants were asked to “Think Aloud” so that we could understand their thoughts. After that, participants were asked to complete two post-task questionnaires: the User Engagement Scale test (UES) and the PAAS subject rating scale, which were used to measure participants’ mental load and engagement with the prototype.</P>
							<br>
							<P>The participants felt that our overall design was clear and intuitive, but some labels needed to be more specific. Also, participants were not clear about the filter in the data visualization part. Participants also provided some recommendations, such as making it cloud-based so they could cooperate with their coworkers. Based on the issues found in the usability test, we redesigned the prototype.</P>
