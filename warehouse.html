								<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
								<h3 id="contentTitle">Challenges of handling increased demand in flooring business amidst booming real estate market.</h3>

								<p>RMI is an interior design company that  specializing in the flooring business. We provide materials and installation services to  our customers across different markets and have multiple warehouses throughout the United States.
									<br>
									The hot real estate market has led to a rapid increase in jobs in the flooring business, and our warehouses are handling more than double the volume of work they did before the increase of demand. However, our warehouse operation team has struggled to maintain their usual level of efficiency.
								</p>
								
								<h3 id="contentTitle">Rebuild warehouse management application to boost efficiency and reduce labor costs</h3>
								<p>Redesigned the warehouse management application to improve warehouse efficiency, allowing warehouse staff to manageincreasing workloads without additional personnel.</p>

								<h4>RESEARCH & DISCOVERY</h4>
								<h3 id="contentTitle">Insufficient information and functionality in the old warehouse management system results in inefficiency</h3>
								
								<p><strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong></p>
								<p>Conducted contextual inquiry research to understand how the old warehouse management system assisted users and observed the warehouse staffs’ working processes and daily tasks they needed to handle through the application.</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>Warehouse Operation Managers Working Process:</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Warehouse Operation Managers Journey Map</strong></p>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/customerjourneymap.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p><strong>User Interview</strong></p>
								<p>Interviewed 25 target users to gain insight into the management of warehouses and the collaboration between warehouse operations managers and account managers. Also, gathered users’ feedback about their experience with the old warehouse management system.</p>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/samplequestions.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Sample Interview Questions:
										<br>
										Can you walk me through your working process?
										<br>
										Which metrics will affect how to assign the supplier and installer?
										<br>
										Do you have any frustrations while using the warehouse application?

								</div> -->

								<h3 id="contentTitle">Insights</h3>
								<ul><strong>#1 Users needed to switch between multiple applications to get work done.</strong></ul>
								<ul><strong>#2 The process of assigning installers was tedious; a simple change requires several steps to complete.</strong></ul>
								<ul><strong>#3 Too much information on the calendar view made it difficult for the user to target information.</strong></ul>
								<ul><strong>#4 There is no view for account managers to overview warehouses’ performance and workload.</strong></ul>

								<h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
								<h3 id="contentTitle">Usability testing confirmed positive user feedback on the enhanced features and clearer interface of the updated warehouse management application, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency.</h3>
								
								<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>
								<p>10 target users were recruited to test our redesigned version of the app. Half of the usability testing was conducted remotely because users were located in different warehouses across the State.</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>Usability Tasks</strong></p>
								<p>Users were provided with a scenario related to their daily job and asked to utilize the real examples from their calendar to test the effectiveness of the new warehouse calendar in completing those tasks. The researcher observed users' behavior and conducted interviews, including follow-up questions, to understand their actions and gather feedback throughout the process.</p>
								<h3 id="contentTitle">Outcomes</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Users feel that the new user interface of the content information is more legible, allowing them to easily skim through the job information on the calendar for their daily schedule.</li>
									<li>Overall, users are satisfied with the new version of the warehouse calendar, which provides them with more useful features to facilitate their work.</li>
									<li>The new color-coded system, indicating the job status, has been incredibly helpful for users in assigning installers and quickly reviewing all their jobs to identify any uncompleted tasks that require follow-up.</li>
									<li>The new features provides users with a quicker way to assign installers, which is very helpful for users and saves them a significant amounts of time in their daily jobs.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>FUTURE ITERATIONS</h4>
								<h3 id="contentTitle">Enhancing user familiarity and future onboarding with comprehensive documentation for the new warehouse management application</h3>
								<p>After using the new warehouse management application for a couple of weeks, users are still not quite familiar with all its functions. They are still accustomed to performing their tasks in the old way. Therefore, it would be beneficial to provide users with documentation that explains how to utilize the application's features in various scenarios. Additionally, this documentation would be valuable for onboarding training purposes.</p>

								<h4>LESSONS LEARNED</h4>
								<h3 id="contentTitle">What did I learn?</h3>
								<p>From this project, I discovered that having a standard process was very important for companies, especially since our company has multiple locations across the States. Those warehouses were previously third-party warehouses, each with its own process, leading to diverse requests for functions and need in the warehouse management system. However, standardized processes were vital for maintaining employee productivity and facilitating future onboarding. As a result, in this project, I started by interviewing all the warehouses about their experience and engaging in discussions with stakeholders to establish the processes and then designed the detail of the system.
